# Advanced Programming - Assignment #7 - Phase #3 - Spring 2020
## University of Tehran
### UTRIP Website!

In the previous phases of this project, we implemented a virtual hotel review and booking system and fully implemented its domain logic. The purpose of this phase of the project is to implement a graphical user interface for the previous phases. This implementation is done on the web platform and based on the client-server model. For convenience, we have a library called [APHTTP](https://github.com/UTAP/APHTTP) for web server implementation.

In this phase we will implement a web server based on HTTP protocol for our application. The browser also acts as a client.
